## Banker's Algorithm Implementation

This project implements the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in a virtualized environment. It simulates resource allocation to multiple clients (organizations) by a cloud service provider, ensuring that resources are allocated safely and efficiently.

### Files

*   `bankers_algorithm.py`: Contains the implementation of the Banker's Algorithm, including functions for checking safe states, requesting resources, and releasing resources.
*   `resource_manager.py`: Manages the resources and clients, using the Banker's Algorithm to ensure safe resource allocation.
*   `client.py`: Simulates clients requesting and releasing resources.
*   `main.py`: The entry point of the simulation, creating clients and resources, and simulating the resource allocation process.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

### How to Run

1.  Navigate to the `experiment7` directory.
2.  Run the `main.py` script using Python:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Overview

The cloud service provider must implement a dynamic resource allocation system to manage the limited resources across multiple clients. The system must:

1.  **Allocate Resources Safely:** Ensure that resources are allocated only if the system can remain in a safe state (where all clients can eventually complete their resource requests without deadlock).
2.  **Avoid Deadlocks:** Avoid scenarios where clients are waiting for resources that are held by others in a circular dependency.
3.  **Allow Dynamic Requests:** Support dynamic resource requests and releases from clients.
4.  **Efficiently Utilize Resources:** Avoid under-utilization of resources while ensuring fairness.
